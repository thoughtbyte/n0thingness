        <h2>2019, unspeakable failures</h2>
        <p>
          I have not fully processed these failures. when I eventually do, there
          will be something to be learned. there always is. we do not talk about
          our failures enough; we're too preoccupied with putting them out of
          sight. we often act as though the world expects us to exhibit success
          and success alone. the media imposes this expectation on us,
          advertisers sell this expectation to us, and we expect this of each
          other, sometimes knowingly, ofttimes not.
        </p>
        <p>be vulnerable. introspect. learn. grow.</p>

        <h2>2017 - 2018, failed engagement</h2>
        <p>I tried. I really tried. but I made the same mistakes.</p>
        <p>
          I was selfish. I was pulled away by a hypomanic state. I hurt someone
          more deeply than I thought I was capable of. it wouldn't be the last
          time (see above).
        </p>
        <p>
          how do we forgive ourselves when we make the same fucking mistakes,
          and commit the same fucking sins, and hurt people in the same fucking
          ways? people that we claim to love. people that we devote our lives
          to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I only know what has just barely begun to work for myself: we accept
          the necessity of a radical departure. we commit to yet another
          metaphysical suicide. the hidden beauty of this world, of your world,
          resides in the fact that we are nothing and because of this each of
          our lived moments is a blank canvas. we choose to no longer be the
          kind of person that would do these things to anyone else. this is an
          invitation to create sent to us by god herself.

        <h2>2005 - 2016, failed academic career</h2>
        <p>
          I spent over a decade pursuing something that I suspect subconsciously
          I knew I would never achieve. I lost a marriage because of this (see
          below).
        </p>
        <p>
          ironically, my research focus was the philosophy of psychology, and in
          particular, self-knowledge and introspection. I lacked the former and
          I was unable to perform the latter. perhaps I had just enough
          self-knowledge to know that I needed to learn about it. unfortunately,
          I was looking in the wrong place. or I was looking at the wrong
          things. there was a presupposition somewhere that self-knowledge was
          ultimately derived from beliefs we have about our selves.
        </p>
        <p>
          self-knowledge is an affective achievement. you can't get closer to
          your goal if you're going in the wrong direction.

        <h2>2007 - 2015, failed marriage</h2>
        <p>I left, emotionally. I was absent in her presence.</p>
        <p>
          during these years, when I was supposed to be emotionally available to
          my partner, I stopped being emotionally available to myself. I was
          depressed. I was experiencing immense shame and guilt for professional
          failures (see above) and for having had my partner follow my own
          dream. but I didn't recognize these mental states as such. they
          manifested themselves as anger. this is one symptom of what we might
          call toxic masculinity. sadness is a weakness. fuck that.
        </p>
        <p>
          the person I was back then no longer exists. therapy has led to a sort
          of metaphysical suicide. I destroyed a past self and created a new
          one. eventually, I forgave myself. this is always an option.
